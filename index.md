Short excerpt of the projects I've been a part of.

## About me

Hi! I'm Tomás. Right now I am a student at CITM to become a video game and app developer, which I'm very keen on. I'm industrious, patient and sedulous, as well as decisive and open-minded. Just so you get to know me, I love video games and I mostly play LoL, Dark Souls III or Minecraft, but lately I've been enjoying Terraria. I also really like English and spending time with my family. Nice to meet you!
